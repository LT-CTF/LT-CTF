Freeciv21 LongTurn Capture the Flag Ruleset
===========================================

The aim of Capture the Flag is to provide an alternative team game experience
to victory by conquest or spaceship. Cities are made difficult to capture with
strong defence buffs, and spaceship are disabled. Instead, each team is
required to build and defend a Flag wonder. The opposing team must move a unit
adjacent to the Flag city to capture it, and return it to their own Flag city
to score points. The game is decided by score after the turn limit has expired.
